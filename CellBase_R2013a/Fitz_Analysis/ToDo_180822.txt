Quick notes on needed updates for MClust 4.4 compatability (in case I don't come back to this for a while)





1)
lightcluster-  depends upon CalculateFeatures which is a matlab package folder in 4.4   (i.e. within a folder called "+Features", folliwing matlabs convention for packages)
Thus it is not accesible on the matlab path in quite the same way

2)
see lines 40-42 in extractSpikeWaveforms.   this is just in my notes, I don't remember why, perhaps its connected to above or below points

3)
plot_mclust_projections and plot_mclust_projections2
involve alternative use of spikes loading engine in which an additional parameter is passed to select a subset of all spikes.   


see  LoadTT_NeuralynxNT0.cpp in  *\MClust_4_4\MClust-4.4\MClust\LoadingEngines\SubCalls:


"/*---------------------------------
* LoadTT0_nt
* MEX file
*
* input:
*    fn = file name string
*    records_to_get = an array that is either a range of values
*    record_units = 1: timestamp list.(a vector of timestamps to load (uses binsearch to find them in file))
*                   2: record number list (a vector of records to load)
*					3: range of timestamps (a vector with 2 elements: a start and an end timestamp)
*					4: range of records (a vector with 2 elements: a start and an end record number)
*					5: return the count of spikes (records_to_get should be [] in this case)
*	 if only fn is passed in then the entire file is opened.
*    if only fn is passed AND only t is provided as the output, then all 
*       of the timestamps for the entire file are returned.
*
* output:
*    [t, wv]
*    t = n x 1: timestamps of each spike in file
*    wv = n x 4 x 32 waveforms
*
* version 5.1
*
* Reads Neuralynx tetrode (TT) files, based on the Windows-family processors.
* by checking if a header exists (for sun TTfiles) or not (for NT-TTfiles)
* Checks for standard Neuralynx header if present (in Cheeath versions >= 1.3)
* and automatically skips header.
